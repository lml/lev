  # Common methods for all handlers.  Handlers are extensions of Routines
  # and are responsible for taking input data from a form or other widget and
  # doing something with it.  See Lev::Routine for more information.
  #
  # All handlers must:
  #   2) call "lev_handler"
  #   3) implement the 'handle' method which takes no arguments and does the
  #      work the handler is charged with
  #   4) implement the 'authorized?' method which returns true iff the
  #      caller is authorized to do what the handler is charged with
  #
  # Handlers may:
  #   1) implement the 'setup' method which runs before 'authorized?' and 'handle'.
  #      This method can do anything, and will likely include setting up some
  #      instance objects based on the params.
  #   2) Call the class method "paramify" to declare, cast, and validate parts of
  #      the params hash. The first argument to paramify is the key in params
  #      which points to a hash of params to be paramified.  The block passed to
  #      paramify looks just like the guts of an ActiveAttr model.
  #
  #      When the incoming params includes :search => {:type, :terms, :num_results}
  #      the Handler class would look like:
  #
  #      class MyHandler
  #        lev_handler
  #
  #        paramify :search do
  #          attribute :search_type, type: String
  #          validates :search_type, presence: true,
  #                                  inclusion: { in: %w(Name Username Any),
  #                                               message: "is not valid" }
  #
  #          attribute :search_terms, type: String
  #          validates :search_terms, presence: true
  #
  #          attribute :num_results, type: Integer
  #          validates :num_results, numericality: { only_integer: true,
  #                                            greater_than_or_equal_to: 0 }
  #        end
  #
  #        def handle
  #          # By this time, if there were any errors the handler would have
  #          # already populated the errors object and returned.
  #          #
  #          # Paramify makes a 'search_params' attribute available through
  #          # which you can access the paramified params, e.g.
  #          x = search_params.num_results
  #          ...
  #        end
  #      end
  #
  # Note that if you want to use a "Boolean" type, you need to type it with
  # a lowercase (type: boolean).
  #
  # All handler instance methods have the following available to them:
  #   1) 'params' --  the params from the input
  #   2) 'caller' --  the user submitting the input
  #   3) 'errors' --  an object in which to store errors
  #   4) 'results' -- a hash in which to store results for return to calling code
  #   5) 'request' -- the HTTP request
  #   6) 'options' -- a hash containing the options passed in, useful for other
  #                   nonstandard data.
  #
  # These methods are available iff these data were supplied in the call
  # to the handler (not all handlers need all of this).  However, note that
  # the Lev::HandleWith module supplies an easy way to call Handlers from
  # controllers -- when this way is used, all of the methods above are available.
  #
  # Handler 'handle' methods don't return anything; they just set values in
  # the errors and results objects.  The documentation for each handler
  # should explain what the results will be and any nonstandard data required
  # to be passed in in the options.
  #
  # In addition to the class- and instance-level "call" methods provided by
  # Lev::Routine, Handlers have a class-level "handle" method (an alias of
  # the class-level "call" method).  The convention for handlers is that the
  # call methods take a hash of options/inputs.  The instance-level handle
  # method doesn't take any arguments since the arguments have been stored
  # as instance variables by the time the instance-level handle method is called.
  #
  # Example:
  #
  #   class MyHandler
  #     lev_handler
  #   protected
  #     def authorized?
  #       # return true iff exec is allowed to be called, e.g. might
  #       # check the caller against the params
  #     def handle
  #       # do the work, add errors to errors object and results to the results hash as needed
  #     end
  #   end
  #
